# 1 Introduction
Where trying to recreate the old classic Haboo. Habbo (previously known as Habbo Hotel) is a social networking service and online community aimed at teenagers. The website is owned and operated by Sulake, a Finnish corporation. The service began in 2000 and has expanded to include nine online communities (or ”hotels”), with users in over 150 countries [>>70288715](https://boards.4channel.org/g/thread/70288715)  

## 1.1 Point of outline
This ”Whitepaper” is trying to specify a path for the project to go. The paper will be written, partially complete to leave some decesions up to the /g/ community via poles.  

# 2 Frontend
I see to major paths this project can take [>>70289125](https://boards.4channel.org/g/thread/70288715#p70289125) and others are intrested in creating a standalone application. We could also stay more true to the original game and develop it as a hmtl5 game. A example is [Habboin](https://github.com/TheNamesRay/Habboin-HTML5) a old abbandoned project.

# 3 Backend
The backend is more open we could go either with nodejs, go, C and many other lanuages but, it seems the community leans more towards C and C++. [Backend pole](https://www.strawpoll.me/17681079) 

# 4 Revive [Habboin project](https://github.com/TheNamesRay/Habboin-HTML5)
Lastly we can create a fork of Habboin and add the missing features. [Revive pole](https://www.strawpoll.me/17682346)
